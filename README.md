Group: Khari Leigh Miller & Jianli Lin
Recreating the website Telegraph.

# Project

Recreate [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/ "Telegraph") aesthetically, then create a RESTful website where the main objective is to create a new post, to view it with the proper endpoint, and to edit it with the proper endpoint. There is no need to create destroy.

#### In short:
* CREATE a new post anonymously
* READ the post with proper endpoint
* EDIT the post with proper endpoint
